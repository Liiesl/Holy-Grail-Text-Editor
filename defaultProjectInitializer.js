# üëã Welcome to Holy Grail!

Hello there! Welcome to Holy Grail, your new space to capture and organize your most important ideas ‚Äì your personal "holy grails"!

We're excited to help you get started. This short, interactive tutorial will show you the basics in a few simple steps.

**Ready to begin?**
*   ‚û°Ô∏è Let's start with [Step 1: Exploring the Sidebar](page://${sidebarPageId}). You'll learn how to find your way around and organize your work.

After that, we'll cover adding content, creating new pages, and more! These steps will guide you through:
*   Using quick "Slash Commands" to add content.
*   Creating and linking pages together.
*   Saving and managing your work.

**Want to see all the cool things you can do at a glance?**
*   You can always check out the [Full Command List](page://${fullCommandListPageId}) for a quick reference.
`;

    const sidebarPageContent = `
# Step 1: Exploring the Sidebar

The sidebar is your main navigation area. Let's see how it works!

## Projects
*   At the very top of the sidebar, you'll see **"Projects"**. This is where all your different work-spaces live.
*   **To create a new project:** Click the **+** (plus) icon next to the "Projects" heading.
    *   *Why not try it now? Give your test project a name like "My Ideas".*

## Pages
*   Each project can have many pages. When you click a project name, its pages appear below it.
*   **To create a new page in a project:** Click the **+** icon next to the project's name.
*   **To create a subpage under an existing page:** Click the **+** icon next to that page's name in the list.
    *   *You can create a test page in your "My Ideas" project, or even a subpage under this "Exploring the Sidebar" page!*

**Navigation:**
*   Clicking a project name shows its pages.
*   Clicking a page name opens that page in the editor.

**What's Next?**
Feeling good about the sidebar? Great! Let's learn how to add content to your pages.

`;

    const slashCommandsPageContent = `
# Step 2: The Magic of Slash Commands

The easiest way to add and format content is with **Slash Commands**.

**How to use:**
1.  Make sure your cursor is on a new line, or after a space.
2.  Type a forward slash: \`/\`
3.  A menu will pop up!
    *   Type to search for a command (e.g., type "head" for headings).
    *   Use your Arrow Keys (Up/Down) to select.
    *   Press Enter or Tab to choose the highlighted command.

**Let's Practice!**
Below this text is a "Practice Zone". Click into the area below the line, create a new line if needed (by pressing Enter), and try out these commands:

---
**üëá Practice Zone: Type Slash Commands Below This Line üëá**
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
*(You can type directly here. After typing each command like \`/h1\`, press Enter, then type some example text.)*

*   Try \`/h1\` (then type a big heading)
*   Try \`/h2\` (then type a medium heading)
*   Try \`/bl\` (for a bullet list: type an item, press Enter, type another item)
*   Try \`/cl\` (for a checklist: type a to-do, press Enter, type another to-do)

---

**Did you try them?**
You should see how easy it is to structure your content! *Even this tutorial page is built with these very same elements like headings and bullet lists.*

# Step 3: Creating Subpages & Links

A very handy feature is creating new subpages right as you're writing. This helps you build connected ideas easily.

**The \`/create-subpage\` command (short: \`/sp\`):**

1.  Type \`/sp\` or \`/create-subpage\` on a new line and press Enter.
2.  You'll be prompted to enter a title for your new subpage.
3.  After you enter the title, two things happen:
    *   A new subpage is created under the current page (you'll see it in the sidebar!).
    *   A link to this new subpage is inserted right where your cursor was.

**Try it now!**
Let's create a subpage. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  Click to place your cursor on an **empty new line** directly below the "üëá **TYPE \`/sp\` ON A NEW LINE HERE** üëá" marker. (If there isn't an obvious empty line, press Enter once or twice after the marker to create one).
2.  Type \`/sp\` and press Enter.
3.  When prompted, type the title: \`My Awesome Test Subpage\` and press Enter.

üëá **TYPE \`/sp\` ON A NEW LINE HERE** üëá
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
*(After you complete the steps above, you should see a link like "[My Awesome Test Subpage](page://...)" appear right where you typed /sp. Notice how all the navigation links in this tutorial, like the "Next up" link below, use a similar format!)*

**Understanding Links:**
The link inserted will look something like \`[My Awesome Test Subpage](page://a1b2c3d4-e5f6...)\`.
*   The part in \`[]\` is the visible text.
*   The part in \`()\` is the actual link, starting with \`page://\` followed by a unique ID for that page.
*   Clicking these links will instantly take you to that page!

**Manual Links:**
You can also manually type links like this if you know a page's ID, but the \`/sp\` command is usually the easiest way for new pages.

**What's Next?**
You're creating content and linking it like a pro! Let's cover how your work is saved and how to manage your pages.
‚û°Ô∏è Next up: [Step 4: Saving & Managing](page://${savingManagingPageId})
`;

    const savingManagingPageContent = `
# Step 4: Saving & Managing Your Work

Good news! Your work is generally taken care of for you.

## Saving Content
*   **Autosave:** The editor automatically saves your changes a few seconds after you stop typing. You'll usually see a status message like "Autosaving..." and then "All changes saved." at the bottom of the screen.
*   **Manual Save:** If you want to save immediately, look for the **"Save Page"** button in the top bar (often near your page title). It will be active if you have unsaved changes.

## Managing Projects and Pages
Need to rename, delete, or duplicate something?

*   In the sidebar, look for the **...** (ellipsis) icon next to each project name and page name.
*   Clicking this icon opens an **Action Menu** with options like:
    *   Rename
    *   Delete
    *   Duplicate
    *   *(And more, depending on the item)*

**Challenge:**
1.  If you created "My Awesome Test Subpage" in the previous step, navigate to it using its link or the sidebar.
2.  Use the **...** menu next to its name in the sidebar to **Rename** it to "Renamed Test Subpage".
3.  Then, if you're feeling brave, use the **...** menu to **Delete** it (don't worry, it's just a test page!).

## You're All Set! üéâ

You've now covered the basics of navigating, creating content, linking, saving, and managing your work in this editor.

**The best way to learn is by doing.** Feel free to explore, create your own projects, and experiment with all the features. This "Welcome" project itself is just another project ‚Äì you can edit these pages too!

Happy writing!
